# Game Instructions
Press **START** to begin your playthrough!
Or, press **SELECT** to access the high score.

The player can move side to side in the bounds of the game.
Press **LEFT/RIGHT** to move.

To win, shoot down all the aliens!
Press **A** to shoot.

Randomly, the aliens will shoot you as their dying wish.
Watch out!! If you get hit by these bullets ONCE, it's **GAME OVER**.
Press **L SHOULDER** to put up blue defensive shields, but be careful because there is a cooldown.
If the aliens reach, it's also **GAME OVER**. :(

Press **SELECT** at anytime to pause the game.

I included all additional mechanics. There is a high score state (in state machine) and a dodge mode (start of updatePlayer), where the ship changes into a defense model (drawPlayer).
