Game Controls

The player constantly moves around the perimeter of the main rectangle.
Press UP/DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT to change direction. 

To win, cut the main rectangle down small enough by drawing lines.
Press A to begin drawing a line.

If the bouncing atom collides with any part of the line, you will lose a life and anything drawn will be undone.
Once you lose three lives, the game ends.

Press SELECT at anytime to pause the game.
You can resume the game at the same spot you paused it.
