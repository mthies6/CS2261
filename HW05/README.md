# Game Instructions
Press **START** to begin your playthrough!

The player can drive all around the map.
Press **UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT** to change directions.

To win, drive around to find and collect all 10 flags.
There are two unique flags: a special one and a lucky one.
The special flag will double flag points for the rest of the level.
The lucky flag will give you bonus points depending on your fuel level.

However, enemy cars will be chasing you the whole time.
Press **A** to release smoke and stop your enemies temporarily.

Watch out! Colliding with an enemy car or one of the rocks on the map will cost you a life.
You start each level with three lives. If you lose them all, its game over.

The top right corner has a fuel meter. Make sure you finsh the level before you run out of fuel, because it's also game over.

Press **SELECT** at anytime to pause the game.

I included additional flag types for extra credit.
